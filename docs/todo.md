## Notes

- **Technology Stack Finalized**: Python FastAPI backend + Next.js 15 frontend
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy 2.0+ with PostgreSQL (production) and SQLite (development)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with bcrypt password hashing
- **Real-time**: Server-Sent Events for live match updates
- **Testing**: pytest (backend) + Jest/Playwright (frontend)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Render (backend)

## Architecture Decision Log

### 2024-01-01: Backend Technology Switch
**Decision**: Switch from Node.js/Express/TSOA to Python/FastAPI
**Reasoning**: 
- FastAPI provides better performance and modern async support
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation generation
- Superior type safety with Python type hints
- Growing ecosystem and excellent developer experience
- Better suited for data-intensive tennis tournament calculations

**Impact**: Complete rewrite of backend documentation and implementation approach
